## Challenges
The main challenge developing goatogether was running into Twitter's Rate Limits. Goatogether relies on users sharing geolocation data to map tweets onto Google Maps. Since not all tweets have location enabled, our program takes all of the searched tweets and filters out the ones without geolocation data. Calling the seach function multiple times within a short period of time, or searching a hashtag with a lot of tweets hits Twitter's rate limit.
